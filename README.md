This repository demonstrates a common error in React's `useEffect` hook where the dependency array is not correctly specified. This leads to unexpected behavior because the effect will not trigger as intended, specifically, the effect only runs after the initial render, making the initial condition check irrelevant. The solution shows how to correct the logic by accurately identifying the relevant state values that must be part of the dependency array.
